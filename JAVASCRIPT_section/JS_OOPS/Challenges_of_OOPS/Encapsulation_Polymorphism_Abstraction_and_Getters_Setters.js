// Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Getters/Setters
// Task 1: Encapsulation Using Getters and Setters

// Create a class BankAccount with a private property _balance. Add methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). Use getters and setters to access and modify the _balance while ensuring the balance never goes negative.



// Task 2: Polymorphism with Method Overriding

// Create a class Shape with a method area() that returns 0. Create two subclasses Circle and Rectangle that override the area() method to calculate the area of a circle and a rectangle, respectively.
